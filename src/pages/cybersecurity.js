      As a full stack developer, having the right set of tools is crucial for your success. In the ever-evolving world of web development, staying updated with the latest tools can significantly enhance your productivity and make you a more competent developer.
  
      In this article, we will explore the top 10 tools that every full stack developer should master in 2023. These tools cover various aspects of web development, including design, coding, and debugging.
  
      So, let’s dive in and explore the tools that can take your skills to the next level.
  
      1. Visual Studio Code – Your Ultimate Coding Companion
      Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a highly popular code editor that has gained immense popularity among developers. Its lightweight yet powerful nature makes it the go-to coding tool for many full stack developers.
  
      With an extensive range of extensions, VS Code can be customized based on your specific needs. Whether you need debugging capabilities, integration with version control systems like Git, or deployment to cloud platforms like Azure and AWS, VS Code has got you covered.
  
      If you haven’t already mastered this tool, it’s high time you do so. Check out the official Visual Studio Code documentation, which is extremely detailed and beginner-friendly and will have you coding in no time!
  
      2. GitHub – Your Collaboration Platform
      As a full stack developer, working collaboratively with other developers is inevitable. GitHub, a web-based hosting service for version control using Git, is the perfect platform to facilitate seamless collaboration.
  
      With GitHub, you can easily manage and track changes to your codebase, work on different branches, and merge code seamlessly. Additionally, GitHub provides a platform for open-source contributions, allowing you to showcase your skills and contribute to the developer community.
  
      Make sure to familiarize yourself with the ins and outs of GitHub to streamline your collaboration efforts.

      content:`There is something fascinating about a lone hacker in black hoodies using a single system and their skills to take down big corporations and their crony capitalism. The anecdote of a hacker has cultivated an ethos of individuality, corporate freedom, and distinct craftiness that can’t be denied. Also, the same archetype is visible in a number of pop-cultural references whether the famous TV series- Mr. Robot or real-life adaptations of Snowden and Julian Assange. Despite all the fascination of hacking, and hysteria, the field of cybersecurity is largely misunderstood outside of the realm of the IT ecosystem.

      On the other hand, organizations/individuals face a series of cyberattacks such as Phishing, malware, DDOS, Man-in-the-middle, SQL injection, Zero-day exploits, DNS tunneling, and many others. Most of these crimes are usually financially motivated. 
      
      There are two types of companies: those that have been hacked, and those who don’t yet know they have been hacked.
      
      JOHN CHAMBERS, FORMAR CISCO CEO
      According to a 2015 report from Cybersecurity Venture, these damages are speculated to reach around 6 Trillion by 2021. Ergo the growing demand for Cybersecurity prevention and professionals. The postings for cybersecurity professionals have grown 3X faster than other IT positions and roughly 12X faster than other professions. So, if you are looking to advance your career in Cybersecurity, this blog will try to outline all the Must-have Cybersecurity certifications and their basic requirements, cost, and other technicalities.
      
      1. CCNP Security: Cisco Certified Network Professional Security
      Fee:$1200
      Although CISCO offers a curated pathway to start from entry-level knowledge to get proficient in the cybersecurity profession. However, we recommend you go with CCNP Security certification. The particular security certification program will prepare you for today’s professional-level positions in system security. It validates the core knowledge you require while offering the flexibility to pick a focus area.
      
      To Earn a CCNP Security, one needs to pass two exams: one defines the core competency. While the other is a concentration exam of your choice.
      
      The core exam, Implementing and Operating Cisco Security Core Technologies v1.0, aims at your expertise and skills in security infrastructure comprising cloud security, content security, network security, endpoint protection & detection, visibility, secure network access, and enforcement.
      On the other hand, the concentration exam aims at new breakthroughs as well as industry-specific topics such as identifying services, Cisco Firepower, email security, VPNs, web security, and automation. You need to pick one of the CCNP security concentration exam from:
      Implementing and Configuring Cisco Identity Services Engine 
      Securing Email with Cisco Email Security Appliance 
      Automating and Programming Cisco Security Solutions 
      Securing the Web with Cisco Web Security Appliance 
      Securing Networks with Cisco Firepower 
      And, Implementing Secure Solutions with Virtual Private Networks 
      Completing both CCNP certification exams will earn you a Cisco® Specialist certification so that you will get accredited by an industry leader in the cybersecurity ecosystem.`
